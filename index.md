Welcome! After nearly three exciting years working toward a Post-Bacc in Applied Computer Science at CU Boulder, I'm embarking on a Job Search Preparation project as part of a Professional Development course. Below you can follow my journey as I gain a better understanding of myself as a job candidate and how I fit in the job market, update job search assets, complete technical and behavioral interview practice, and be challenge myself to be more connected to my local tech community.
