        <h1>Hi, I’m Tiffany</h1>
        <p>Technical Program Manager | Software Developer | Product</p>
        <p>Welcome! It's been nearly three exciting years working toward a Post-Bacc in Applied Computer Science at CU Boulder. It's been an incredible experience, I've learned a ton, and completed many <a href='https://tiffanylarue.github.io/2026/01/10/CU-Boulder-Projects.html'>challenging projects</a>! I'm embarking on a Job Search Preparation project. <a href='https://tiffanylarue.github.io/archive.html'>Follow my journey</a>, as I gain a better understanding of myself as a job candidate and how I fit in the job market, update my job search assets, complete technical and behavioral interview practice, and connect to my local tech community.</p>
