## Job Search Preparation (Candidate-Market Fit, Job Search Council, and Networking)


Vision statement: I will gain a better understanding of myself as a job candidate and how I fit in the job market, have updated job search assets, complete technical interview practice, and be better connected to my local tech community.
Motivation: I am starting a job search, and want clarity around what I'm looking for and roles I would be well-suited for. Additionally, I want to be better connected to the local tech scene, and prepared for job applications and interviews.
Specific and measurable goals:
Continue moderating a Job Search Council (JSC) through the Never Search Alone (NSA) program, attend/lead all relevant JSC and moderator meetings, and keep members motivated via Slack
Complete all NSA exercises, including the Mnookin 2 Pager, Listening Tour, and Candidate-Market Fit
Update experience log, resume and LinkedIn with recent job and CSPB experience, industry best-practices, and feedback from reviewers
Hone my elevator pitch
Look into Mock Interview services
Attend one local tech Meetup per week
If time permitting: complete courses on TPM interviews, and possibly PMP exam prep
Risks to project completion, 
Possible distraction if I jump in a job early that doesn't match what I'm looking for and without doing the pre-work
Trouble focusing on job-mode while finishing school
My dog doesn't like to be alone and I'll have to leave him home while going to meetups
Hopefully skin issue from last semester stays at bay
Mitigation Strategy for the risks listed above:
Revising my plan is always possible
Schedule time blocks for school and job-related items
Remind myself that my dog can be alone for a little while
Project Assessments - provide a list of evaluation criteria for the project.
I feel better prepared to apply and interview for jobs
I am clear on the direction and target roles/skillsets I'm looking for
I have made genuine connections in my community with people I would feel comfortable reaching out to
My JSC feels supported by me as their moderator, and we stay on track with our program
