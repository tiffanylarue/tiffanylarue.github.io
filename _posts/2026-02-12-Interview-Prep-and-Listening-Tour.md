## Interview Prep and Listening Tour

### Last Week
In my job interview prep, I took and passed the Amazon assessment, which was an interesting experience in itself. It was an online assessment, about 1-2 hrs. When I learned I passed, I realized I need to speed up my STAR story preparation and try to do a mock interview. Through the NSA program, I learned about two recruiters who offer interview prep services for a fee. One is a former Amazon recruiter so I had a free intro call with her on Sunday. She mentioned that I should find out which Leadership Principles (LP) my interview will focus on, and what the timeline is for the interview (to inform when I schedule my interview call). I didn't even know I could ask those things! I followed up with my recruiter and got answers to both of these, as well as additional helpful info about the role. I also reviewed the first email she'd send and realized there were tons of links to additional resources. Earlier I'd watched the short videos on each of the LP's. I ended up setting up a mock interview for tomorrow with the former recruiter, and she sent me homework - which I need to do later today! Inspired by the JSC Listening Tour, I also reached out to a former coworker who is at AWS now, and asked if we could meet to discuss the Amazon interview process. I felt brave even just reaching out, and I shared with my JSC about it, since we've been encouraging each other to overcome our fears. I met my coworker yesterday and it was both nice to reconnect, even putting my brain in work-mode, and we had a productive conversation. 

This morning we had our JSC call and had great conversations overall about the gratitude exercise and interviewing. I haven't written my 10 thank-you notes yet to  those that helped me in my career, but I did create a list of 10 people.

One JSC member is interviewing tomorrow with past company, and I'm going to help her mock interview this afternoon. That will also be good practice for me to prep for my own mock interview tomorrow.

I had three tech meetups scheduled this week, and while I wanted to attend, I decided to skip them in favor of getting interview-ready.

I also attended a Super Bowl party, and got to have some interesting career conversations there as well. Two friends also answered some general questions I had about tech interviews (ok to focus on older stories if they are better / more suited to the question, and the level of preparation needed).

### This Week
I will mainly focus on getting 6 STAR stories in place, typing them to LPs, mock interviewing, and having the actual phone interview Tuesday. After that I can take a breather, and maybe I'll find a tech event later in the week.

### Impediments
I feel low on time overall, although I prioritized meeting my various Thursday school deadlines, so I'll have some time to focus on interview prep before the mock interview and the weekend. In a way I almost need the fire of the deadline to motivate me action on the STAR stories. This will be a great exercise for all future interviews.

### Reflections / Improved Process
I told a couple friends that I needed to focus on school and interviewing for the next 1-2 weeks, so that is helping me focus and be productive again. I feel that I am being a bit agile in my project - still covering topics I planned but in a different order than I originally thought. I think I'll continue this agile approach going forward, focusing whichever topic is of highest priority at that time.
