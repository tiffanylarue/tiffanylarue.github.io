## Women in Tech Event and Amazon Assessment

### Last Week
On Thursday I attended a Women in Tech event that I'd bought tickets to a couple weeks ago. The organizers had another "Tech Mixer" event at the same time and location, but the women that were there seemed to seek each other out to connect, maybe about 20 of us total. It was a really nice time and I met people at all levels in their career. There were quite a few early career women, and it was interesting to hear the kinds of questions they had. Many were software engineers, and one of them was interested in finding more meaning in her work, which she wasn't finding in her current company. From past career coaching I've done, I recommended to start by discovering/understanding her values and I shared some resources with her. There was another who had 4 years of work experience under her belt, but felt that being a developer was causing her to be more introverted. She was thinking about what the next step in her career should be - SWE manager or Program Manager, which she felt may require an MBA and found it challenging that you need to specialize in a domain of knowledge. While I went to the event for my own networking/career seeking purposes, I found it very fulfilling to offer my own advice/counsel based on my years of experience in the field. It was also a great place to work on my elevator pitch, since each new person I met would ask what I do, and what I'm looking for. Interestingly there was even a therapist in attendance, who did not work in tech, but was curious to learn more about the female experience working in tech, since some of her clients were women in tech. That sparked some interesting conversations, like some entrepreneurs who realized their clients tended to be mostly women, and they pondered why that might be. Many of us connected on LinkedIn and I think will try to attend some other tech meetups together in the future.

When the event ended, I met some others that came to the venue, and one (who "builds AI for AI") offered to help me with my technical interview prep, so we're meeting tomorrow.

Today, a recruiter from Amazon followed up on my application (a non-technical role), so I watched videos on their 12 Leadership Principles before I take the Assessment tomorrow. This video explains the assessment. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7CPJplsdTU And the LP videos are here: https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles 

Tomorrow is our JSC meeting. We've been keeping in contact on Slack and sharing updates and support. Two members started their Listening Tour. I've identified people to meet with but need to set up the meetings. Tomorrow are our Mnookin Two Pager presentations. One of our group members built a second app this week via vibe coding - in just 2 hours!  She also got accepted to a free seat in an AI Prototyping workshop.

I went through Meetups and found a few tech events in the next few weeks that I'll aim to attend. 

### This Week
This week I'll take the Amazon assessment, finish and present my Mnookin Two Pager, and get ready for Gratitude House (a list of people who have helped me in my career) for the JSC.

There are two popular tech meetups on Monday and Tuesday I'm planning to attend. 

### Impediments
My sleep schedule has been off so hopefully it will balance again and my concentration will improve.

### Reflections / Improved Process
One JSC member expressed her gratitude for our group this week, and today I also was feeling glad to have the group to share updates with, bounce ideas off, and gain/share motivation.

I definitely feel like I'm doing a lot of context switching lately with all the varied activities I'm working on. I wonder if there are any operations in my life right now that I an automate. 🤔
